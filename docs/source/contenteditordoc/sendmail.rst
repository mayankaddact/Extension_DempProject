Now, we need to pick the automated message created in EXM. This message will be send upon submittion of the form.

Next, we need to choose who will be the recipients of the mail.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   sendmail/currentcontact
   sendmail/fixedemail
   sendmail/formfieldvalue

When using :ref:`FileUpload` fields in your form, you can choose to add them as an attachment of the email.
